The purpose of this program is to view 10 'beats,' all of which you (the user), create.


You do not need to read the instructions here if you don't want to.
You can just run the program from ExecuteVisualizer.java and read the instructions there.


Instructions:
1. Click the 'Start!' button. The Options, Color selection and Beat visualizer windows 
will appear. 

2. Using the first drop-down menu in the Options window, select a beat.

3. On the Options and Color selection windows, choose the desired size, shape, 
color, fill, frequency and name for the beat  that is currently selected.
*Do this for as many of the beats as you wish. You may  leave the properties of 
all the beats unchanged, if you wish.
**The Beat visualizer window is resizable in order to accomodate large shapes.

4. When you're satisfied with your beats, go to the 'Beats visualized' window.

5. Select the beats that you want to view.

6. Click on the 'Play selected beats' button. The selected beats will play 
continuously until you hit stop. You can choose to view a new set of beats 
simply by unchecking those you do not want to see, checking those you do want
to see and again clicking the  Play button.
NOTE: You can change the properties of your beats at anytime,even when they're 
playing. The changes will be reflectedimmediately.
